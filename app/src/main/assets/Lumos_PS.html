		<b>Problem Statement</b>
<p>Build autonomous robot that can differentiate between a number of light sources

of similar intensity kept inside an isolated room (Arena) and turn each one off.</p>

<b>Task</b>
<p>The robot has to begin its run from a predefined position in a dark 

isolated room with the light sources kept in different directions w.r.t. the initial 

position of the robot. There will be no guiding path on the floor of the arena. The 

robot has to decide its path by light detection only. The objective is 

to switch off the maximum number of light sources by the end of the runtime.</p>
</div>

<b>Round 1 :</b>
<ol>
<li>There will be a total of 5 light sources placed in the room.
</li>
<li>All the light sources will be stationary.
</li>
<li>The total runtime for this round is 5 minutes.
</li></ol>

<b>Round 2 :</b>
<ol>
<li>There will be a total of 6 light sources placed in the room:
<ul style="margin-left:15px;">
<li>4 of the light sources will be Stationary.</li>

<li>2 of the light sources will be moving at a maximum speed of 4 cm/s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The total runtime for this round is 7 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<b>Arena</b>
<ol>
<li>The light sources will be placed at any random positions in the arena.

</li><li>The actual positions of the light sources in the arena will be disclosed just 

before the commencement of the run.

</li><li>The arena will be enclosed by walls on all sides. The walls will be covered 

by black cloth.</li>
</ol>
<b>Round 1 :</b>
<ol>
<li>The arena is an enclosed circular area of radius 3.0m.
</li>
<li>The starting position will be a 60 cm sided square in the arena.
</li></ol>
<b>Round 2:</b>
<ol>
<li>The arena is an enclosed circular area of radius 3.0m.
</li>
<li>The starting position will be the same as in the first round.
</li></ol>

<b>Light Sources :</b>
<ol>
<li>Each light source will be a cylindrical setup of height 25 cm and diameter 25 
</li>
cm.
<li>The intensity distribution of the each light source measured individually, in a 
</li>
completely dark room, will be nearly the same.
<li>All dimensions have a tolerance of 15 %.
</li>
<li>The rating of the bulb to be used for all light sources is 100 Watt, 220 V.
</li>
</ol>
