<b>Problem Statement</b>
<p>Distraction IUPC is an IUPC-style programming contest crossed with various distractions (you will get to know when you enter in the contest arena!), where teams of three people try to solve as many programming problems as they can. Meanwhile, our Distraction Team will be doing what they can to make the job of programming more difficult and/or enjoyable.</p>
