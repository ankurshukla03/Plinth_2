		<b><font size="4">General Rules</font></b>
<ol>
<li>No abstract submission is required for the event.
</li>
<li>Each team can consist of a maximum of 4 members.
</li>
<li>Each team should have unique participants i.e. no two teams can have even 
any common participant.
</li>

<li>The team members can be from different institutes or colleges.
</li>
<li>The right spirit of participation is expected from the participants.
</li>
<li>The decision of Team PLINTH will be final and binding on all participants.
</li></ol>

<b><font size="4">Event</font></b>

<b><font size="4">Stationary sources</font></b>
<ol>
<li>There would be stationary light sources present in the arena in both the 
</li>
rounds.

<li>The intensity distribution of the each light source measured individually, 

in a completely dark room, will be nearly the same.</li>

<li>The robot has to reach each light source and bump into the metal 

plates present around each light source. This would deactivate the light 

source i.e. it would be switched off.</li>

<li>The light source is considered to be deactivated only if it is switched off. 

In case  a  robot  collides  and  the  source  is  still  illuminated  it  would   

be considered as an active light source.</li>
</ol>

<b><font size="4">Moving sources</font></b>
<ol>
<li>There would be two moving light sources present in the arena during the 

second round of the event.
</li>
<li>The moving light sources would be autonomous having pre-defined 

algorithm and they would be moving in an unknown path.
</li>
<li>The moving light sources can be deactivated in the same way as stationary 

light sources.
</li>
<li>The moving sources will stop automatically upon deactivation.
</li></ol>

<b><font size="4">Traversal</font></b>
<ol>
<li>The robot must avoid colliding with already deactivated sources as it 
traverses towards another light source. Collision with any deactivated 
light source will lead to a penalty.</li>

<li>For the time bonus to be rewarded, it is compulsory to deactivate at 
least two (2) light sources before the end of the run, in case the 
participant wishes to call off the run before the allotted run time.</li></ol>

<b><font size="4">Initial Orientation of Robot</font></b>
<ol>
<li>The participant is allowed to decide the initial orientation of his robot but 

it should be such that it is not facing any light source directly.
</li>
<li>Team PLINTH reserves the right to disallow any initial orientation of the 

robot inside  the  starting  zone  if  it  gives  the  participant  an  undue 
advantage solely based on the judge's discretion.
</li></ol>

<b><font size="4">Restarts & Timeouts</font></b>
<ol>
<li>A maximum of 2 Timeouts of 2 minutes each may be taken in the first 

round. For the second round a maximum of 3 Timeouts of 2 minutes each 

may be taken.</li>

<li>In both the rounds, a Penalty will be awarded for each timeout and the 

robot will start from the last light source it has deactivated, if none have 

been deactivated then from the start zone. In case of multiple robot, this 

rule is applicable to each of the robot individually.</li>

<li>The participant's robot can have a maximum of three restarts in both the 

round. Restarts, if any, will apply to all the robot.  A penalty will be 

imposed on the team for every restart that they take.</li>

<li>In case of a restart the participant's robot will be set to their initial 

positions. Timer will be set to zero and the run will start afresh with the 

addition of the penalty for restart.</li></ol>

<b><font size="4">Robot Specifications</font></b>
<ol>

<li> The robot must fit inside a cube of side 55cm when measured. No 

part/mechanism of/on the robot should exceed the given dimensions 

before the commencement of the event run. The robot can exceed their 

respective dimensions once the event commences.</li>

<li>The autonomous robot should be Onboard processing robot, i.e., 

the robot cannot be controlled by a remotely kept computer. The 

Processor used for on the robot must be at maximum 16 bit processor.</li>

<li>LEGO kits or its spare parts or premade mechanical parts are not 

allowed.</li>

<li>Ready--made gearboxes, sensors, development boards can be used but 

no other part of the robot should contain any readymade components. 

Simple car bases with no extra features may be used.</li>

<li>The robot should not harm the arena in any way. If it does so, a penalty 

will be imposed on the team. The magnitude of the penalty will be decided 

by Team PLINTH.</li></ol>


<b><font size="4">Technical</font></b>
<ol>
<li>All the dimensions of the arena and light sources are to be considered with 
a tolerance of 15%.
</li>

<li>The robot can be powered on-board as well as off‐board.
</li>
<li>No kind of external control will be allowed.
</li>
<li>All circuitry and sensory equipment should be placed on the robot adhering 
</li>
to the ROBOT SPECIFICATIONS.

<li>Participants will have to bring their own programmers, cables and software. 
No programmers will be provided.
</li>
</ol>
