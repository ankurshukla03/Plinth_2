<li>The person who have made the robot should be able to explain the circuit and the
program uploaded(if any).</li></ol>

<b>Team Specification</b>
<ol>
<li>Any team can participate in Robo Race, Plinth. A team may consist of 3 to 4
member Participants. These participants can be from same or different institutes.</li>
