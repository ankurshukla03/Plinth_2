<p>Line follower robots were one of the earliest automatic guided robots. They are able to follow a line marked on a contrasting background, usually a black line on a white surface or vice-versa. For Beginners it is usually their first robot to play with. It’s the most basic example of adding small intelligence to a robot, but it’s actually the designer’s intelligence!!<br><br>
