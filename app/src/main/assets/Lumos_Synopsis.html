Light is something we all crave for, something we all seek. It is time for robots to

express those same desires. In this autonomous event there are no guides   

no lines or walls or objects to look to. The only way forward is to perceive 

the luminosity of sources scattered around the arena, in an attempt to switch off 

as many as possible before time runs out.<br>
