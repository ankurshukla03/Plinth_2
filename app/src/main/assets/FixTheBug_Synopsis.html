<p>How right the 'Bard of Avon' was! Every programmer who has crossed skill levels beyond the "hello world" phase, has learnt to fear those mysterious fiends called bugs. Seeing the enigmatic 'seg. fault' on the screen sends chills down the spine of even some veterans! To deal with such entities requires a level patience and skill that escapes ordinary programmers. Think you are up to it? Are you one of those gifted few who can spot a bug like the eagle does a mouse? Why doubt when you can find out !</p>
