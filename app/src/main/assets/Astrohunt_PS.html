<li>At the beginning of the Astro Hunt each team will be given a map of the LNMIIT Campus 
and a Sky chart. 
</li>

<li>Astro Hunt will consist of 4 rounds.

puzzles which must be solved in order to find a piece of information. This information 

could be words from a historical astronomical event, name of a star, planet or any other 

celestial body, cosmic theories or just a name of a person. The clues and puzzles will be 

related to astronomy in some manner and will lead to a location/check point within 

walking distance where players will use a vital piece of information to answer a 

question.

teams will get a flag and the clues/puzzles for the next round.
