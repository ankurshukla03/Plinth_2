	<b>Problem Statement</b>
<p>
The challenge is to create a robot (manually controlled / autonomous) whose sole purpose is
to push, throw, flip, drag, or otherwise move your opponent out of the arena within a 
stipulated time. This event aims to test your Robot against another in a field of combat 
where brute strength and cat-like reflexes hold the key to success.</p>
