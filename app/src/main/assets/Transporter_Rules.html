<b>General Rules</b>
<ol><!-- 
<li>All the students enrolled in high school, undergraduate, postgraduate (excluding PhD.) program at any recognised institute (identity card will be checked) are eligible to participate.</li> -->
<li>A team can consist of a maximum of 4 members.</li>
<li>Each team must declare a name for their team at the time of competition.</li>
<li>The machines you build will be first checked for size and safety. The machine should not cause electric power breakdowns.</li>
<li>The machine must not contain any combustible, corrosive, or otherwise dangerous materials for safety reasons. No explosive compression or decompression, either internal or external is permitted.</li>
<li>Judges have the right to disqualify any machine whose working mechanism or game strategy is considered hazardous in any way.</li></ol>

<b>Scoring</b>
<ol> 
<li>For saving common people 20 points .

</li><li> For saving Courtier to 50 points.

</li><li>For saving king 100 points 

</li><li> If you take a retry -5 points 

</li><li>if people or king falls outside of pits no points will be given or deducted.</li>
</ol>
<b>Structure Of The Tournament</b>
<ol> 
<li>First round: Top 5 teams will qualify based on total points scored 

</li><li>Final round: Top 5teams will compete

</li><li>Arena and obstacles of final round will be different from first round
</li>

</ol>
<b>Game Procedure</b>
<ol>
<li>Length: 10 minutes</li>

<li>As many as retries can be made only after the referee gives permission in cases such as when the   

robot is declared immobile.</li>

<li>Only the 2 team members per robot are allowed to touch the robot while placing it 

back to the retry point whose names should be given to coordinators before the game 

starts.</li>
</ol>
<b>Cautions In Robot Design And Development</b>
<ol>
<li>Maximum dimension limits for manual bot is 400 x 300 x 250mm
</li>
<li>If any of the machines uses an externally placed power supply, the external power 
supply is not included in the size constraint. However in case of on-board power 
supply, the machine along with the power supply should fit in the above mentioned 
dimension box.</li>

<li>The machine must use only mechanical power or mechanical power converted from 

a source of electrical energy. 

</li><li>During the game the machine is allowed to expand as much as it can, provided it 

does not damage the arena.</li> 

<li>In case of electric power supply, the voltage at any point must be lower or equal to 

24V DC during the game. 

</li><li>The organizers will provide a standard 230V/50 Hz AC power supply. 

</li><li>Any eliminator, adaptor, etc. required will have to be arranged by participants 

themselves. No special demand will be entertained. 

</li><li>The manual bot must be controlled by wired or wireless remote control mechanism 

at all stages of game.  In case of wired mechanism the wire must be slack at all point 

of time during the game. 

</li><li>The machine should not leave spare parts in the arena at any stage. This can lead to 

a time penalty or may even lead to disqualification.</li>

<li>Devices like hot air balloons/rockets which assist the machine in movement in any 
way are not permitted. Any kind of assistance for locomotion through wall is 

prohibited.</li>
</ol>
<b>Violation And Disqualification</b>
<ol>
</li><li>During the match, the team members are not allowed to touch the machine or the 

arena without permission of referee. Failure to do so will lead to disqualification. 

</li><li>Any kind of damage to the arena will attract disqualification. 

</li><li>The teams will be asked to get ready 15 minutes before the start of their task. If a 

team is not ready within the stipulated time, they may be disqualified.

</li><li>In any case, the decision of the judges will be final if they feel that any team is not 

playing with fair interest.</li>
