<b><font size="4">Problem Statement</font></b>
<p>Asgard is a newly found planet just like Earth with the following alterations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rotation period of 50 hours and revolution time of 489 days.
</li>
<li>Saline water covers 50 percent of the planet and fresh water is 2 percent of the entire 
water content.
</li>

<li>Existence of no lethal uncontrollable alien species.
</li>
<li>Transportation and communication technology have been developed to an extent that we 
can reach this planet in three months and any communication signal requires two days to 
get delivered.
</li>

<li>The average temperature of the planet is from three to ten degrees Celsius.The planet 
has no seasons.
</li>

<li>Presence of no fossil fuels.
</li>
<li>(Bonus point) Following point is not mandatory but extra points would be awarded if 
considered: Gravity is half of that of earth.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To cater to the needs of our ever increasing population and depleting resources, the human 

civilisation has to see it's dawn on Asgard, for a comfortable continuation of the species. 

You have been assigned this tough task to turn into an achievable probability. Describe how 

this could be done by designing a settlement for 10,000 people.  Use your creativity while 

keeping in mind the above mentioned facts to build upon different aspects of a colony. For 

example production, distribution and storage of food, management of waste, the problems 

that would be faced, governing health of people.</p>

<b><font size="4">How the Event would Proceed</font></b>
<ol>
<li>An abstract is to be submitted.This abstract should be at least 500-600 words.
</li>
<li>Your abstract would be evaluated on how many different aspects you have deliberated 
upon and how many of these are in line with the physics of the planet.
</li>

<li>On the basis of your abstract you would be selected for the second round.
</li>
<li>In the second round you need to present your abstract and ideas in the form of a 
presentation.
</li>
</ol>
<b><font size="4">Format of the Project</font></b>
<ol>
<li>The project should be submitted in a pdf.
</li>
<li>There is no strict format that you need to stick to. Make it as comprehendible as possible. 
</li></ol>
<b><font size="4">Evaluation</font></b>
<ol>
<li>Your report would be evaluated on how many different aspects you have deliberated 
upon and how many of these are in line with the physics of the planet.
</li>

<li>The more descriptive you are, the more points your report will score.
</li>
<li>Use can use diagrams and pictures.
</li></ol>
